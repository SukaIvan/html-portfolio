<h1>The best Movies According to Ivan</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>1. Seven samurai</h3>
<p>The message at the end of the movie stuck in my memory - samurai always lose and peasants always win.</p>
<h3>2. The Unbearable Lightness of Being</h3>
<p>He lives so simple, makes decisions very easy and they are always right. I envy him.</p>
<h3>3. Whiplash</h3>
<p>His professor used technics I disagree off but the question is would he be so good if he used diferrent technics.</p>
